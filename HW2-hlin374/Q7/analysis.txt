1. Ease to develop for developers

     Tableau: Easiest. Developers can use it directly.  
     D3: Hardest. Developers need to write codes in javascript which is not friendly at all.
     Python: Moderate. Developers need to write codes but it’s easier and it's powerful too.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.)

     Tableau: Easiest. Different versions can communicate.
     D3: Hardest. Difference in versions will make the codes vary greatly.
     Python: Moderate. Difference in versions will bring in new functions and codes also vary.

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users

     Tableau: Worst. If users don't buy it, their access is extremely limited.
     D3: Best. With a well designed html, users can do many things.
     Python: Moderate. Users need to use python to do more.
 
4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets

     Tableau: It's easy for it to visualize "large" datasets.
     D3: DOM manipulations of large data can be very slow.
     Python: The speed can't be ideal at all times.

5. System requirements to run the visualization

     Tableau: Install Tableau.
     D3: Use browsers supporting JavaScript and W3C DOM API.
     Python: Install python and import certain libraries.
